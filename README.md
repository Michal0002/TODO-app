# Todo App
   \
The Todo app helps you be more productive, relieve memory and reduce stress by easily planning your day and organizing your life.

With Microsoft To Do, you can:
	* login/registration (each user has their own todo list)

	* adding, editing and deleting new tasks
 
	    * additionally, we can define task priorities - which one is more important to us (low, medium, hard)

    	*  deleting a task is tantamount to changing its status to canceled - the data in the line will be deleted.
